              Mario is a fictional character created by Japanese video game
              designer Shigeru Miyamoto. He is the title character of the Mario
              video game franchise and the mascot of Japanese video game company
              Nintendo. Mario has appeared in over 200 video games since his
              creation. Depicted as a short, pudgy, Italian plumber who resides
              in the Mushroom Kingdom, his adventures generally center on
              rescuing Princess Peach from the Koopa villain Bowser. Mario has
              access to a variety of power-ups that give him different
              abilities. Mario's fraternal twin brother and sidekick is Luigi.
